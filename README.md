Kakushi diary is a preview of the diary, as the name suggests, is to use squares in the form of written diary, invented by Japan's "morning diary" founder Misaki Sato. There are nine different sections of the ninth palace, which are usually dated in the middle, and can record important dates, time and weather conditions. The content can be as successful pat diaries, interpersonal relationship, energy management (food, dynamic and static), financial management, mental training (reading and writing), etc.. Everyone can set it according to his own situation.

Last night Zhang Yongxi listening to the teacher's lessons learned JiuGongTu format of morning diary writing, he is a well-known Time Management Lecturer, has written 10 years of morning diary. The morning diary can record yesterday, today. Gather feedback through records, daily and weekly to see where you are doing well and which places need to be improved. I believe that everyone is concerned about their progress.
